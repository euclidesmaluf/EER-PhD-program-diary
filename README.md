# EER-PhD-program-diary
This repository documents my doctoral development within the Engineering Education Research (EER) PhD program at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL). The structure, milestones, reflections, and materials included here are intentionally aligned with the specific academic requirements, evaluation criteria, and professional expectations of the UNL program.

The purpose of this project is to organize my intellectual growth, document research progress, and systematically track key components of doctoral training, including coursework, research development, methodological preparation, scholarly dissemination, and professional identity formation.

It is important to note that PhD programs vary significantly across institutions, disciplines, and national systems. Coursework structures, qualifying examinations, candidacy requirements, research expectations, and graduation criteria differ from one university to another. Therefore, while this repository may serve as a reference or inspiration, anyone seeking to adapt this structure should carefully review and follow the official requirements of their own institution and doctoral program.

This diary reflects one specific academic pathway within a particular institutional context.
